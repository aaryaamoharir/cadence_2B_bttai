## 🎯 **Project Highlights**

- Developed a machine learning pipeline using natural language processing, feature extraction, and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to help Cadence product designers identify which software features users like or dislike based off of the Amazon 2023 reviews dataset. 
- Conducted baseline experiments using BERT and feature extraction models, identifying early accuracy plateaus (55–63%) and designing strategies to improve training efficiency.
- Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), uncovering noise, inconsistent formatting, and ambiguous feature mentions in product reviews—informing preprocessing and modeling decisions. For example, discovering class imbalance between different ratings. 
- Generated actionable insights to inform business decisions at Cadence using a Streamlit dashboard.
- Implemented the ABSA Model(Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Model) to address industry needs around fine-grained user sentiment insights.

## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

**Describe:**

This project was completed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Studio, where teams work with industry partners to deliver machine learning solutions to real-world problems.

Our host company, Cadence, asked us to analyze product reviews to better understand:

1. Which software features users discuss most
2. Sentiment associated with each feature
3. Areas of improvement and opportunities for customer satisfaction

The goal of the project is to design an aspect-based sentiment analysis model capable of extracting fine-grained insights that traditional sentiment analysis cannot provide. This work has real-world significance for user experience design, product engineering prioritization, and customer-driven innovation.
